## Analyzing LEGO data
Python's $pandas$ library reminds me of LEGO bricks, giving data different shape and order. And "The LEGO Group" says: "In a world of distractions, LEGO wonders for Adults offer a focused and mindful activity. A creative recharge. A zone of zen. A place to find your flow." I expand the company's philosophy, having fun with pandas DataFrame structures on a quite interesting LEGO dataset:

- the set is divided into 8 parts, including numerical data as well as text data
- import Images
- see LEGO Taj Mahal with the massive 5922 pieces
- visual chart, Number of parts in a LEGO set
- in progress... I guess a work with data never ends...
