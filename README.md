## LEGO data
"In a world of distractions, LEGO wonders for Adults offer a focused, hands-on, mindful activity. A creative recharge. A zone of zen. A place to find your flow." LEGO Group

I expand the company's philosophy, showing pandas DataFrame structures on a quite interesting LEGO dataset:
- the set is divided into 8 parts, including numerical data as well as text data
- import Images
- see LEGO Taj Mahal with the massive 5922 pieces
- in progress... I guess a work with data never ends...
